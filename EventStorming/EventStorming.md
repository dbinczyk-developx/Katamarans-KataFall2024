# Event Storming

## Context and Requirements

In today's competitive job market, both candidates and employers are increasingly seeking efficient, fair, and unbiased hiring processes. In an era where diversity and inclusion are paramount, our recruiting application seeks to address common challenges faced by both job seekers and recruiters. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, candidates will receive tailored tips to enhance their resumes, ensuring they present their skills and experiences in the best possible light. Additionally, to combat unconscious bias and promote fairness in hiring, the application will include an anonymization feature that obscures personal information, allowing employers to evaluate candidates solely based on their qualifications.

## Collecting events

Collecting events during an Event Storming session is a collaborative and iterative process that allows teams to gain a shared understanding of the current business processes. This foundational knowledge is crucial for designing robust systems that align with business needs. By focusing on events, stakeholders can visualize the flow of information and decisions, ensuring that no critical elements are overlooked in the system design. The resulting event map will serve as a valuable reference for further discussions, modeling, and eventual system implementation.
