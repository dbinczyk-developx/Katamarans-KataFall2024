## Team topologies

We considered the application of Team Topologies principles to create an appropriate team distribution across the main
business value streams. Instead of enforcing a rigid team structure, we propose a flexible, non-binding team
organization. Key areas requiring special attention are:

- AI and Machine Learning modules, with a focus on continuous improvement of the AI engine.
- Integration with external HR systems.

Given the relatively low complexity of the core domains, we recommend against splitting the workforce into smaller,
specialized teams. Instead, assigning 2 people to each of these key areas would effectively balance the cognitive load
across the team.

Considering the low budget and startup nature of the project, we advise against creating separate platform teams,
enabling teams, or teams dedicated to complex subdomains.
