# AI-Powered HR Platform for Bias-Free Candidate Selection

## Problem Statement

The current applicant tracking software (ATS) systems are ineffective in matching viable candidates with job
descriptions and do not address bias in hiring. Traditional ATS lacks impactful metrics to identify and reduce biases
during the interview and selection process.

## Technology Solution Description

We propose an HR platform that leverages AI to construct candidate stories based on S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable,
Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound) goals, qualifications, and experience. These stories are quantifiably aligned with
open roles, ensuring an objective candidate evaluation. Personal identifiable information and characteristics are
anonymized until the system determines the best candidates to move forward. Companies can pay to unlock the full
profile, and data points are aggregated to reveal disparities between those hired and those rejected.

### Tagline

**Transparent Decision Making**

## Users

- **Employers**: Companies that aim to provide a more equitable hiring experience to career seekers.
- **Job Candidates**: Professionals seeking a less tedious and more equitable hiring process that values their skills
  and abilities.
- **Administrators**: Platform managers responsible for registering users, providing data analytic reports on company
  performance, and delivering DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) consulting services to executives.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. The platform must leverage AI to re-construct job seeker resumes into a S.M.A.R.T goal format and quantifiably align
   their experience to open roles posted by hiring managers.
2. The system must generate a **Similarity Score** or match percentage between job descriptions and candidates.
3. AI must provide **resume tips** to job seekers to help them improve their profiles.
4. AI must eliminate potential racial, lifestyle, cultural, or other bias-inducing indicators.
5. The platform must include back-end **data aggregation** for process analytics.

### Key Data Points

- **Data Point 1**: Decision to move forward with a candidate.
- **Data Point 2**: Unlocking a full candidate profile for interviews.
- **Data Point 3**: 5-question survey for job candidates regarding their interviewer.

### Reporting

Monthly data and analytics reports will present KPI metrics relating to the interview and hiring processes, offering
insights into bias reduction and efficiency.

## Hiring Manager User Journey
