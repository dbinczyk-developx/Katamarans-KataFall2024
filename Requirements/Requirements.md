Problem Statement
-----------------
 - **Problem Statement #1:** The lack of impactful metrics that identify and reduce potential biases in
the job candidate hiring and interview process.
 - **Problem Statement #2:** The redundancy and ineffectiveness of the traditional ATS (applicant
tracking software) matching viable candidates with job descriptions.


Proposed Solution application
--------------------------
The proposed solution is an AI-driven HR platform designed to reduce bias and improve transparency in the hiring process. It addresses two key business challenges: 
 - the lack of effective metrics to identify bias in interviews 
 - the inefficiency of traditional applicant tracking systems (ATS). 

By anonymizing candidates’ personal information and using AI to align their qualifications with job openings, the platform ensures more objective hiring decisions. Additionally, DEI consultants can monitor and evaluate interviews to provide insights for reducing bias. The platform also generates data-driven reports to help companies track and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
