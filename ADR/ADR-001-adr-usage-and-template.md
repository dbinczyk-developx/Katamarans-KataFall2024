# ADR-001: Using ADRs and following template

## Date:
2024-09-25

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
Project team needs to document architectural decisions made during this excersise.

## Decision:
Architecure Decision Records were selected as a way to document all of the decisions made and this document should be used as a template to document future decisions.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- **Clear Documentation of Decisions:** ADRs provide a clear and structured format to document the reasoning behind architectural choices, making it easy for future teams to understand why decisions were made.
- **Historical Record:** ADRs serve as a historical record, so teams can trace back architectural decisions, understand the context in which they were made, and see how the system evolved over time.
- **Accountability:** ADRs assign responsibility by recording who made a decision and when, making it clear who to consult for any clarifications or follow-up.

### Cons:
- **Risk of Overdocumentation:** Some teams may overuse ADRs, documenting trivial or obvious decisions, which can lead to unnecessary complexity and information overload.
- **Difficult for Complex Decisions:** Some architectural decisions may involve multiple layers of complexity, making it difficult to capture all the nuances and evolving aspects within a single ADR.
- **May Not Capture Informal Decisions:** Not all decisions are made formally. Some small or spur-of-the-moment decisions may not make it into an ADR, leading to incomplete documentation.
