# Event health formula

In an event-based architecture, the fitness function can be defined to evaluate the health and efficiency of the system based on the percentage of failed events. This fitness function can be expressed as follows:

## Description

This fitness function measures the system's performance by calculating the ratio of failed events to the total number of processed events. A lower percentage of failed events indicates a healthier and more reliable system, while a higher percentage signals potential issues that require attention.

## Formula:

$$
EventHealthFormula = 1 - \frac{Number of Failed Events}{Total Number of Events}
$$

- **Number of Failed Events:** The count of events that did not complete successfully.
- **Total Number of Events:** The total count of all events processed by the system (including both successful and failed events).

## Interpretation:
- A fitness score close to 1 (or 100% in percentage terms) represents a well-functioning system with minimal failures.
- A fitness score closer to 0 indicates a system facing numerous failed events, suggesting the need for improvements in event handling, error recovery, or system design.

Using this fitness function allows developers and system architects to monitor and optimize the reliability of their event-driven systems over time.
